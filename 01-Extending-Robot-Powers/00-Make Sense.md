###The Role of sensor in controlling
The control help us interact with the physical world, by using the sensors and actuators we can get the automation system to help manage the environment round us in a desired ways. The sensor act as an input for the information from the physical word to the control and automation systems. 
The aim of this lesson is to discuses the role of the sensors in control system and give an example of one of the these sensors. 

If you want to control the system then you need to know few things, first you need to know what you want the system to do. For example, if you want to set the home temperature then you controlling it by the thermostat. This way the system will know what it has to do. The control system need to know something else too, which is how well they system is working. For example the thermostat tells the system how much is the temperature and whether it is bellow or over the wanted to be. Here in this step the sensor do their job for example the temperature sensors used to give a feedback about the performance of the system. 

### Ultrasound sensor 
Robots need to obtain as much data as possible about the environment, measuring the distance is one of the fundamental part of this data. 
In robotics, the ultrasound sensor is one of the most common sensor used for measuring distance of an object. The sensor display the distance in inches and can detect up to 60 inches of the distance. 
The ultrasound is a high frequency sound that exceeds the human hearing range.

The ultrasound works similar to the principle of radar to locate the objects. Where the reflected high frequency from an object is received. In order to measure the distance to an object, the delay between the transmission of the ultrasound and return of the echo is measured. Similarly in the way of how the Bat navigates in the dark. 

The ultrasound sensor has two parts:
1- A transmitter: sends the signal that is over the human ability to hear.
2- A receiver: receives the signal that is bounced back of an object in front of the sensor.
