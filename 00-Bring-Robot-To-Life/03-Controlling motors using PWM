##What is the servo motors? 
The servo motors (or servos) ----- You can found these motors many places: from toys to home electronics to cars and air-planes. it can be used to control steering in the remote control vehicles, or control the angles of surface due to the its ability to rotate through about 180 or sometimes continuous rotation, and of course robot wouldn't be exist without the servo motors. 
(need a picture for a servo)


###How does Servomotors work?
Servo motors consist of:
 1- Small direct current(DC) which spin at high rotation per minutes but give out very low torque (it is a twisting force something smiler when you open a jar, you in fact apply a torque). 

2- A gears slow down the high speed of the motors while increase the torque at the same time.

Gears could be either made form plastic in case of the cheap servo motors, or made of metal for the higher expensive motors that design for heavier work.
Now the way this motors work is receiving a feedback from a sensor positioned on a gear. This sensor that connected to a small circuit board, tells this circuit about the information of the servo rotation. Moreover, there is a signal received by the circuit and decoded to give the user the option about how far the servos should rotate, also determine to which direction to rotate to give the desired position.

To simplify the concept, imagine you instruct a friend for where your you wants him to go in a play field, you need to continuously ask your friend to move forward/ stop/ move backward in order to place him in the right position. Now, if you are a microprocessor and your friend is a simple motor then you need sometime to watch and give a command to place her in the right position this called a feedback loop. WHile if your friend were a servo motor, then all what you need to do is to say "go to 4.5 meters" then this would lead him directly to the right spot. 
This is why the servos is simple and useful to use for many robotic application since it has this automatic seeking behaviour, which mean you need only to tell what you wants to be done and the servos to the rest easily. 




1- Connect the black wire of the servo to the ground GND of the arduino. 
2- Connect the red wire of the servo to the +5V pin of the arduino. 
3- Connect the yellow/white wire of the servo to the digital pin on the arduino.
