###Control Your Robots Brightness

In the first lesson we ran a sketch without knowing how its code works or hows its sent to the robot. Here is where we'll begin to learn to speak robot using a proper programming language. Arduino sketches are written in a version of the C language. Lets see what happens if we type some normal text into the Ardunino IDE and send it to the microcontroller.  In the Arduino IDE open up a new file and type the following:

```
What kind of robot are you?
```
If we press *upload* we'll see there's some problems with this:  

The Arduino IDE checks the code to look for errors and it will complain if there are any issues. Finding  **errors** and **fixing errors** are a major part of programming and its very helpful for our development environment to catch these errors. (IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment).    You can see that with our natural human text the IDE is not happy:

```
Arduino_tutorials.ino:1:1: error: ‘What’ does not name a type
```
###Learning robot lingo
Machines do not yet speak English, Spanish, or other human languages.   Programming languages are made to communicate with machines and there are many programming languages that can be learnt.   Fortunately learning programming languages is much easier than learning a  languages, and it doesn't need to take long to learn the language of robots. 

All you need to do is follow the rules of the language and practice writing code.   As soon as you learn the language you'll be  commanding your robots in no time at all! 

The following steps are focused on giving you the foundations and basics of programming in C. For more details of the particular language we're using and how that compares to other languages please see the **programming** tab. 


##### HOT TIP
In the world of humans you don't need to speak or write correctly to be understood (though it sometimes helps!).  The world of machines is different where precision and correctness is extremely valuable.  Errors in code are the biggest cause of problems and losses of time.  For this reason it really pays to take care and bring attention to detail to your coding. This requires patience and focus though believe me, getting in the habit of this now will save time and grief in the future.

So the IDE did not like our human readable text so now lets see what happens if we simply upload acompletley blank document. Delete all the text in your text and upload to the micro controller. 

```
core.a(main.cpp.o): In function `main':
/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/main.cpp:11: undefined reference to `setup'
/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/main.cpp:14: undefined reference to `loop'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

```

Again the IDE throws an error. 

Now open **Basic-Structure.ino**. And try uploading this.  Whilst this sketch doesn't have a single useful command it does enough for the IDE code checker to be uploaded to the microcontroller without error. 

```

####Sketch fundamentals
Lets look closer at the standard code that forms the basis of every working sketch. Firstly lets look at the comments:

```
//This is a one line comment 

/*this 
is 
a multi-line
comment
*/

```

In most programming languages specific character combinations are used to signify comments. These are ignored by the compiler (or parser) and they are used only to help us humans.  In C a multi-line comment is started with **/\*** and ended with **\*/** and single line comments are signified with **//**.  Use comments as much as you can to help yourself and others understand and follow your code.

The first non-comment section is :

```
Void setup() {
}
```

This shows the correct syntax for declaring (or creating) a function called **setup**.  In arduino some functions like **digitalWrite** are already defined so there’s no need to define them in your sketch. You must *or* can define other functions for yourself.  **setup** and **loop** are the two functions you must declare in every sketch that you write and together these form the basic structure of an arduino sketch. 


![Arduino Tutorials](https://github.com/RaghadHAV/arduino-tutorials/blob/master/Images/setuploop.png)

The word “void” indicates that nothing is returned by the function. Some functions return values whiles others do not. The name of the function comes after the keyword "void" followed then by parentheses to contain arguments if there are any, in our case there are none. A curly braces are used to include the things to happen when the function is called. These curly braces and the code are all together known as a "Block".

When the arduino sketch starts running, there are things need to be done only once therefore you use "setup" function to define it. Whereas, there are other things need to be happened continuously and for this purpose you use the function "loop".
So, what do we need to put inside "setup" function that will be ran only once when the sketch starts? Let's see:

```
void setup()
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(13,High);
}

void loop() 
{

}

```

The "pinMode" and "digitalWrite" are built-in function (already defined function). pinMode set a specific pin in the arduino to be either input or output. In this example we set the pin number 13 to be the output. The digitalWrite  sets this pin to be HIGH or LOW (light on or light off) which is the pin of the LED on the arduino broad. If you run the code above, the LED will light on/off once!
Now, let's make the LED light on/off continuously. Modify the code to look like this: 

```
void setup()
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  
}

void loop() 
{
  digitalWrite(13,High);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(13,LOW);
}

```
You need to call "pinMode" function only once, therefore you can leave it inside the setup. Notice that the project will still work if you move the "pinMode" inside the "loop", but it is better to use things once if you need them only once.
The loop function consists of three lines: the first line is digitalWrite set the output to be hight (5V). "Delay" line would simply wait 500 millisecond. The third line set the output to be low. 
Run the sketch and notice the output. Is it what you expected? Is the LED blinking? So, the LED is on all the time. Trace back the code, can you tell where is the problem?  
Let's see:
1. Set the output to bin number 13 in "setup".
2. Set the pin to be high to turn the LED.
3. 500 millisecond wait.
4. Then turn the LED off. 
5. Run the "loop" again, to turn the LED on.

Wait! in step 4 there is no time for the LED to be off, because this very fast and the next thing would happened is turning the LED on again in step 2. Correct! you need to wait sometime before turning the LED on again. 
Edit the code to look like this:

```
void setup()
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  
}

void loop() 
{
  digitalWrite(13,High);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(13,LOW);
  delay(500);
}

```
Now run the sketch again. You can see the LED blinking on and off every one second.

####Learn To Get The Help You Need
It is possible to learn just about anything from freely available resources on the internet. The key question is knowing which resoruces to use. This course is complete and we believe provides the fastest and most powerful way to learn. There is though one  resource that we recommend is used for enhancing and supporting your learning on this course. 
- [Arduino Language Reference](www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Setup) This is a concise and well written guide on the arduino language. As the course progresses we'll refer to relevant pages on it. Please end by taking a look at the Language Reference Site and the descriptions for the **setup()** and **loop** functions in particular.  As the course progresses further references will be made to this resource.
