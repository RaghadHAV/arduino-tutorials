### Ultrasound 
Robots need to obtain as much data as possible about the environment, measuring the distance is one of the fundamental part of this data. 
In robotics, the ultrasound sensor is one of the most common sensor used for measuring distance of an object. The sensor display the distance in inches and can detect up to 60 inches of the distance. 
The ultrasound is a high frequency sound that exceeds the human hearing range.

The ultrasound works similar to the principle of radar to locate the objects. Where the reflected high frequency from an object is received. In order to measure the distance to an object, the delay between the transmission of the ultrasound and return of the echo is measured. Similarly in the way of how the Bat navigates in the dark. 

The ultrasound sensor has two parts:
1- A transmitter: sends the signal that is over the human ability to hear.
2- A receiver: receives the signal that is bounced back of an object in front of the sensor.
